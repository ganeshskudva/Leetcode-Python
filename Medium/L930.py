    def numSubarraysWithSum(self, nums: List[int], goal: int) -> int:
        """
        This function calculates the number of subarrays whose sum is exactly equal to `goal`.
        It uses a sliding window technique to first compute the number of subarrays with sums 
        at most equal to `goal` and then subtracts the number of subarrays with sums at most 
        equal to `goal - 1` to get the number of subarrays with sums exactly equal to `goal`.

        Parameters:
        nums (List[int]): A list of integers consisting only of 0s and 1s.
        goal (int): The target sum for the subarrays.

        Returns:
        int: The number of subarrays whose sum is exactly equal to `goal`.

            This helper function calculates the number of subarrays whose sum is at most `tgt`.
            
            Parameters:
            tgt (int): The target sum for the subarrays.

            Returns:
            int: The number of subarrays whose sum is at most `tgt`.

            Time Complexity: O(n), where `n` is the length of `nums`. The sliding window ensures that 
                             the `left` pointer moves as necessary, and the `right` pointer iterates 
                             through each element exactly once, making this part of the solution linear.

            Space Complexity: O(1), since only a few variables (`left`, `res`, `tgt`) are used, 
                              regardless of the input size.

# Time Complexity: O(n), where `n` is the length of `nums`. The sliding window ensures that
