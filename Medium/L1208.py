class Solution:

        """
        This function calculates the maximum length of a substring where the cost of changing characters
        from string `s` to `t` does not exceed `maxCost`. The cost is defined as the absolute difference
        between the ASCII values of corresponding characters in `s` and `t`.

        Parameters:
        s (str): The input string `s`.
        t (str): The target string `t`, where we want to transform `s` to match `t`.
        maxCost (int): The maximum cost allowed for transforming `s` to `t`.

        Returns:
        int: The maximum length of a valid substring of `s` that can be transformed into `t` without exceeding `maxCost`.
