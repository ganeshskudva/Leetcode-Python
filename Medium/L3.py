# Time Complexity (TC): O(n), where n is the length of the string 's'.
# Each character is processed at most twice: once by the right pointer and once by the left pointer when adjusting the window.

# Space Complexity (SC): O(min(n, m)), where n is the length of the string and m is the size of the character set.
# The dictionary `mp` stores up to m characters in the worst case, but typically itâ€™s proportional to the length of the substring.
