# - Each pointer traverses up to the root, covering a maximum of h steps. 
# - If they donâ€™t meet on the first pass, they meet on the second, totaling O(h) steps.

# Space Complexity (SC): O(1)
# - Only two pointers (`a` and `b`) are used for traversal, making it a constant space solution.

# Space Complexity (SC): O(h)
# - The recursion stack and the `ancestors` set both use space proportional to the height of the tree.
# - `ancestors` may store up to h nodes in the worst case, and the recursive call stack can go as deep as h.
