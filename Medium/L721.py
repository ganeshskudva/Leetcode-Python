# Overall Complexity Summary:
# Time Complexity: O(n * k log k), where n is the number of accounts and k is the average number of emails per account.
#   - Building the graph (adjacency list) takes O(n * k).
#   - DFS traversal takes O(n * k) since we visit each account and email once.
#   - Sorting each accountâ€™s emails takes O(k log k), and we sort for each component.
# Space Complexity: O(n * k), for storing the graph, visited list, and the result.
#   - `visited_accounts` requires O(n) space.
#   - `emails_accounts_map` requires O(e + n) space, where e is the number of unique emails.
#   - `res` requires O(n + e), storing merged accounts with unique emails.
