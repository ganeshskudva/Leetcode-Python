# Time Complexity (TC):
# - Sorting the intervals takes O(n log n), where n is the number of intervals.
# - After sorting, we perform a single pass through the intervals, which takes O(n).
# - Therefore, the overall time complexity is O(n log n) due to the sorting step.

# Space Complexity (SC):
# - The space complexity is O(n) for storing the merged intervals in the `res` list.
# - Sorting modifies the input list in-place, so no additional space is used for sorting.
# - Overall, the space complexity is O(n), as `res` may store up to all intervals in the worst case.
