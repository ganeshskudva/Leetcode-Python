# Time Complexity (TC): O(n + m), where n is the length of str1 and m is the length of str2.
#     - We iterate through str2, which takes O(m).
#     - For each character in str2, we may need to iterate through a portion of str1, which takes O(n) in total.
#     - Thus, the combined time complexity is O(n + m).

# Space Complexity (SC): O(1), as we use only a few variables and no additional data structures.
#     - No additional memory is allocated proportional to the input size.
#     - The space usage remains constant regardless of the input sizes.
